    "The graph above compares the runtime performance of the BucketSort algorithm for two different scenarios:\n",

    "Evenly Distributed Input: In the evenly distributed case, the input values are more likely to be uniformly spread across the buckets. As a result, the sorting of individual buckets is efficient, leading to a better runtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unevenly Distributed Input: In the uneven distribution scenario, a large number (e.g., 10,000,000) is added. This causes the elements to be placed unevenly in the buckets. Some buckets may contain many elements, while others may have very few. As a result, the sorting of buckets becomes inefficient, increasing the overall runtime.\n",

    "\n",
    "Explanation of Trends\n",
    "\n",
    "Evenly Distributed Case:\n",
    "\n",
    "The runtime increases gradually as the input size (n) grows. Since the input values are evenly spread, the elements are more uniformly distributed across the buckets, \n",
    "leading to efficient sorting. The runtime growth is close to linear due to this balanced bucket filling.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unevenly Distributed Case:\n",
    "\n",
    "The runtime grows more rapidly as the input size increases. This is because a large number disrupts the uniformity of the distribution, causing one bucket to receive disproportionate number of elements. Sorting within these overloaded buckets becomes more time-consuming, leading to a higher overall runtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the BucketSort algorithm performs well with evenly distributed inputs, but its efficiency is negatively impacted when input elements are unevenly distributed."
